# react-perf-examples
Examples for my ReactJS Cear√° meetup talk

## Running examples

You'll have to run both the API and the client; to do so, run these two commands in different
terminal windows/tabs/sessions:

```bash
yarn start:server

yarn start
```

The server should be running from `http://localhost:8181` and the React app should be available from
`http://localhost:8080`.
